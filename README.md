# Machine Learning Models Repository

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating various machine learning models and techniques. Each notebook focuses on a specific algorithm or process, providing insights into their implementation and use in different data analysis scenarios.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **`EDA.ipynb`**  
   This notebook performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a given dataset. It includes various techniques for visualizing data distributions, identifying outliers, and understanding feature relationships.

2. **`KNN.ipynb`**  
   This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for classification tasks. It covers the process of training the model and evaluating its performance.

3. **`K_means.ipynb`**  
   This notebook illustrates the use of the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm for unsupervised learning tasks, such as grouping similar data points into clusters.

4. **`Naive Bayes.ipynb`**  
   This notebook demonstrates the **Naive Bayes** classifier for supervised classification tasks, including text classification or binary classification problems.

5. **`Regression.ipynb`**  
   This notebook covers various **regression models**, such as linear regression, used for predicting continuous values based on input features.

6. **`Decision Tree.ipynb`**  
   This notebook explores the **Decision Tree** algorithm for classification and regression tasks, illustrating how decision trees can be built and evaluated.
